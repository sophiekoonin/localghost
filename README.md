This is the source code of localghost.dev! 

You're welcome to steal any code from this site, as long as you have a go at making it your own and not just copy it straight up.

Like many other people in the early 00s, I learnt to build websites by clicking View Source, copying bits I liked, then changing them slightly (that, and absorbing the contents of lissaexplains.com). 

I still strongly believe in learning from others and passing it on.



## note to my future self
Installing on a new computer: make sure to run `npm_config_arch=arm64 yarn add sharp` to get the image processing working
