In true bandwagon style, I decided to write my own 'decade in review' blog post after seeing a few others. These posts can be interesting in our industry not only to get to know a person a bit better, but to learn more about the path their life took before they ended up in tech. And while I ended up studying for a Masters degree in Computer Science, I got there in a roundabout way, and I very nearly didn't do it at all. But I also recognise I have been privileged to have the opportunities I've had, through people my family have known, and through having a place to live rent-free in London for a part of the journey.

The hardest thing about writing this post was actually remembering what happened - I've tried to present the highlights (and lowlights), and the strange variety of careers that I considered along the way. 

## 2010-11

The decade began with rejection! Having dropped out of university in 2009 after a year of studying German and Spanish (I really didn't enjoy the course and it was horribly underfunded), I decided I had a new-found drive to Actually Study Properly, and applied to Cambridge University to study Linguistics. I *completely* bombed the interview, being asked all sorts of questions about things I didn't know the answer to (and wouldn't learn until I, uh, studied linguistics), and being grilled about my student finance situation by the director of studies at the college I'd applied to (which I later learned they weren't supposed to do). It was so humiliating that I cried when I got out of the interview. Luckily I had a place to study Linguistics at the University of Manchester, so it wasn't all bad (and in fact I think this was much better for me). In May, my family moved to London, where I bided my time until September working in a cinema. 

Come September 2010, I was really excited to start university again at the age of 21. While I was still young, the couple of years I'd spent a) at a university and b) working made me much more confident to speak up in lectures, more so than some of the others that had just left school.  Ultimately, I got more out of the academic experience starting at 21 than I did at 19, though maturity-wise, I may as well have still been a teenager! 

In my much-delayed "teenage rebellion" of my early 20s, I took up roller derby and dyed my hair blue. I don't think I've ever grown out of it. (Sadly the roller derby career was short-lived, but the hair and the dress sense hasn't changed much!)

Honestly? I don't remember a whole lot of what happened in 2011. I studied, made friends, worked at a bar, and moved into a student house where my housemates and I would play Rock Band into the night.

## 2012

This year was pretty terrible for my mental health. I came off the anti-depressants I'd been on since I was 18, my mood tanked and my long-standing anxiety problems returned with a vengeance. After crying nonstop for weeks, I went back to the doctor and started a different medication which helped me get back on track. I also found a little choir in Manchester called SHE Choir, and started going to their rehearsals. 

In the summer, through a friend of my uncle's, I got a six-week internship at digital media company Razorfish in London. At the time, I had no idea what I was going to do when I got out of university, and the incredibly vague world of "digital media" seemed like an option worth exploring. I worked for three weeks in the SEO team and three weeks in the media planning (ad buying) team. I don't remember a lot of what I was doing, and SEO is still very much not at the top of my list of "things I would do again, even for money", but I vividly remember walking past some of the developers at the company and thinking what they were doing looked much more interesting. But I could never do that, right?

 Meanwhile, I was in love with linguistics. I focused on historical linguistics and syntactic theory, learning about everything from the history of negation in English and German to syntax trees and formal logic (which would end up resurfacing in my studies of Computer Science). 

## 2013

In the throes of a complete obsession with makeup, and without much other direction in life, I decided I'd become a makeup artist when I left university. I researched courses and started a makeup blog, filming some pretty terrible tutorials. 

After throwing myself into my studies, I graduated proudly with a First in Linguistics, and in July I moved back home to London. I started attending SHE Choir again, which by now had expanded to London, and I started arranging music for it.  

In June I was invited to a housewarming party and I very nearly didn't go, but dragged myself out because I didn't have any friends in London so thought I might meet some nice people. Making a beeline for the group of people at the party who were "from the internet", I ended up chatting to a lovely man for most of the night. We swapped numbers and became good friends. 

I'd given up on becoming a makeup artist by this point - it seemed like a lot of investment and time for a career that might not even pan out. My cousin worked in the same building as a small digital media and PR agency, and after introducing me to the founders I interviewed and got myself a month's internship. Their specialism was social media, and because of my interest in beauty, they put me on an account for a waxing company. I had to do "engagements", which meant replying to any tweets that could conceivably be linked to waxing or eyebrows. (Not-so) fun story: the company offered what they called "social bookings", which was the ability to book an appointment for a wax via Facebook or Twitter. What this *really* involved was someone messaging asking for an appointment, and then me (a PR person) calling the salon to book their appointment. There was a salon in New York, and we were expected to pick up these bookings on weekends too, which was how I ended up calling a salon in New York from my personal mobile on a Sunday at 7pm to book someone's brazilian wax. 

At the end of the four weeks, I was offered a job for Â£16k/year which I accepted because I thought the company would be cool, but after reading through the contract (which stated that they could let me go for mental health reasons) and realising that I didn't want to spend the next year tweeting about eyebrows and booking people's bikini waxes, I quit. 

At this point, once again directionless, I decided to look into the possibility of teaching. I still loved languages, and was good with people, so I figured I'd go and live in Spain for a bit and come back and be a Spanish teacher. After messaging various universities that offered teaching courses, it turns out this is not a thing you can do (I needed a degree in Spanish), so I decided to do a CELTA qualification instead, in order to teach English as a foreign language. The plan was to go and live in Spain and teach English until I figured out something else. In October, I booked on a four-week course in Madrid, due to start in February 2014.  

With several months to kill before going to Spain, I went back to my part-time job at the cinema. By this point I realised I had feelings for my friend from the party, and we started seeing each other in December. While I wouldn't usually advocate changing your life plans because of a relationship, I had a strong feeling I shouldn't move to Spain and should instead come back after the course in Madrid (spoiler alert: reader, I married him).

At this time I stumbled across the edX [CS50](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science) Introduction to Computer Science course (probably on Reddit). Growing up building websites, I had always been interested in coding but hadn't really tried anything beyond HTML, CSS and stealing other people's JavaScript code, so I decided to give it a go and started learning C.

I was instantly hooked. And not only that, I was *good at it*. The absolute joy that I felt when something I'd been struggling with compiled and ran and output the right thing - I still get that feeling to this day.

**## 2014**

Maybe there was something in this coding thing. And if you want to make a career of it, you have to do Computer Science, right? Well, no, but I thought so at the time. Before I left for Madrid, I looked around and found a Computer Science course at Birkbeck, University of London - a year-long conversion course designed for people without a background in CS or Maths. I applied, and got a place for the course starting in October.


In February I went to Madrid, did an exhausting month-long English teaching course, then came back and taught English in London for a few months until October rolled around. (While it may seem like an odd choice to go ahead with the course, for one thing I'd already paid for it but the skills I learned would prove to be invaluable in my career.)


October rolled around, and I started my masters. I couldn't have done it without being able to live with my parents, which I recognise is an extremely fortunate position to be in. It was hard work, but I enjoyed it: I learned Java, Scala, SQL, a module on "Information Systems" that seemed to mostly consist of the lecturer going off on various unrelated tangents, how computers work, how the internet works, most of which I have forgotten six years later. It was both frustrating and fascinating, but most surprising was how much crossover there was with areas of linguistics. Programming languages have syntax and grammar, just like human languages, so a lot of the methods of study are the same. 


Towards the end of the year, the founders of SHE Choir announced they were moving on, and I took over as one of the organisers. I built a new website (Wordpress again, naturally), wrote an arrangement of Poison by Alice Cooper which is still one of my favourite things I've ever done, and made a lot of spreadsheets. 


## 2015 

As the year began, I started to think about what I would do next, and over a coffee with an old friend I was reminded about graduate schemes as a potential way to land a good job. I did some research and found the John Lewis Technology graduate scheme. If you're not familiar with it, John Lewis is a large UK department store, known for being a good place to work - in fact as a teenager I'd worked at Waitrose which is part of the John Lewis Partnership. My aunt had been at JL for many years, so I thought it was worth a try. I did the (completely irrelevant) psychometric test and filled out all the application questions.

The next step was a video interview, but there was nobody on the other end - it was automated. I had the very odd experience of answering questions but only being able to see my own face. Somehow, I passed that, and was invited to an assessment centre, which is the longest and most unnecessary job interview you could ever have. At this all-day interview in a conference centre I had to prepare and give a presentation, write an essay(!) on my thoughts on various technology options for stores, do a group exercise where we roleplayed store managers, and finally a one-on-one interview which was, well, a normal job interview.  The next day, I got a phone call telling me I got the job - I was over the moon.

The summer was mainly spent holed up in the British Library writing my masters project, a Java transpiler which would transpile a "simplified" version of Java for learners into actual Java. It remains among the worst things I've ever written - including a series of if-statements with so many branches that IntelliJ refused to parse them. It can't have been that bad, though, as I graduated with a distinction - I was very proud. I handed in my project and two days later started my job at John Lewis. 

I often wonder what would have happened if I'd just gone straight into a development job after my masters instead of a graduate scheme. As part of the two-year scheme I had to move around different parts of IT, including more "traditional" areas like Business Analysis and Operations. In some of my placements I was treated like work experience, often having to ask for more work to do and being given tasks rather than feeling like part of the team. Frustrated, I started finding excuses to code, such as writing scripts for a business process modelling tool (teaching myself JavaScript in the process!) or automating manual processes I came across.


After chatting to the Head of IT Innovation in the work cafe one day about not having much work on, he invited me to work on a [store installation for Smart Home technology](https://www.forbes.com/sites/rachelarthur/2016/04/08/experiencing-the-smart-home-john-lewis-new-try-before-you-buy-tech-space/). This was a turning point. Working with my colleague Yusuf, we learned Node.JS and wrote a little app that connected to the Philips Hue and Nest Thermostat APIs. It would receive UDP packets from an Arduino, and change the colour of the lights or the temperature on the thermostat programmatically. This was synced with different videos on a TV, or a "window" that showed different seasons and times of day. It was a ridiculous and fun project, and I learned a lot from it. 

## 2016

Having been extremely vocal about my desire to be a developer, I was moved onto my development rotation in 2016. Teams were reluctant to take on graduates for development rotations, as usually they couldn't code - we were promised at the interview that graduates would be sent on courses to learn to code, but we weren't - and there wasn't much support at management levels for mentoring at that time (this did change, ultimately). Luckily, my experience with Java and JavaScript gave me an advantage, and landed me a place on a team building API gateways for the website. I wrote a script that would later bring down the website. 

A few months later, following a short but fun stint learning Objective-C and Swift on the iOS team, I was moved into a "project management" role (complete with PRINCE2 qualification which I've never used). The placement evolved into more of an agile coaching role, which was actually pretty fun - I was working with some wonderful people (including [Dan North](https://dannorth.net), who I learned a lot from) and we organised an internal tech conference. 


My work with SHE Choir continued to the point where I was effectively running the choir with one other person, and it was becoming too much work for me. I started looking at ways I could lighten the load, and wrote a Slack app in Python that took attendance for me so I didn't have to. 

In September, I got engaged!

## 2017 

This year was when everything changed. After another couple of frustrating placements in Testing and Operations roles, where most of the work was done offshore so there wasn't a lot for me to do, I had made enough noise and got well-known enough in the department from the extracurricular things I was doing that a senior person in our division recommended me for a role in a new team within John Lewis, called JLP Ventures. They'd asked for two JL developers to join the team and learn from the [Thoughtworks](https://www.thoughtworks.com) developers that had kicked off the project - a recipe box delivery service in the vein of Hello Fresh. I joined in May, and immediately felt at home. I was learning React, working in an 80% female dev team (made up of fantastic people I am still friends with to this day), pair programming with awesome developers and working FAST. We'd ship to production at least once a day, including on Fridays. The stack was React, Node and MySQL, and we were responsible for all of it. There were post-it notes everywhere and we'd break down work and work iteratively. I had ideas, and I was trusted to build them. I realised that this was what working as a developer could be like. 

One of the biggest lessons I learned that year was the importance of blaming processes, not people. I was demonstrating our webapp to a work experience student, showing him how we "roll over" the system for a new week on a Monday: we would click a big green button to upload new recipes, charge all our subscribers, and place new orders for them. Unfortunately, I accidentally demonstrated it on the live website, on a Wednesday, which meant all the recipes were wrong and we'd double-charged a load of customers. I thought I'd be hung up to dry, but everyone was so lovely about it and I didn't get in any trouble. Ultimately, if it hadn't been one big green button to do all the things, the impact would've been a lot less. 

Sadly towards the end of the year the shine wore off a bit: the development of the project was outsourced to an offshore company, so it was back to John Lewis IT for us. A man from the vendor company joined our team during the transition: in our first conversation, he implied that I wasn't a good enough developer because I didn't know enough about "optimising further down the stack" (on a Node.JS app?), and would direct all his technical questions to my male counterpart. After I gave a lunchtime talk to the team about gender inequality in tech, he suggested that in the future it might go the other way and women will start oppressing men. We spent an unpleasant week in Kiev meeting the (otherwise lovely) dev team there, where he made lewd comments about my female colleague and told me I needed to loosen up, amongst various other inappropriate things I won't go into. It made me so anxious that I was horribly ill that week. Mercifully, he was asked to leave the team when we got back, and I received an "apology" email saying he was "sorry I was offended". 

This was the year I got involved with the tech community in London. After I sent a frustrated tweet to London Node User Group asking why they hadn't had a single female speaker since their inception, [Michelle](https://twitter.com/msmichellegar) invited me to mentor at a [Node Girls](https://nodegirls.com) workshop - it was fantastic. I started going to more meetups and getting to know some of the lovely people in the tech industry. In December, Greta from [ReactJS Girls](https://www.meetup.com/ReactJS-Girls-London/events/) invited me to apply to speak at their conference, ReactFest, in March 2018 - I'd given a few talks at work, and with both the experience of teaching English and leading a choir it seemed like something I could do. My application was accepted and I started preparing my 10-minute talk on redux-saga! I practised it at a meetup first to get a feel for what worked and what didn't.

And I finally took a step back from managing SHE Choir, resuming my role as admin queen instead. 

## 2018

This year was set to be a busy one: I was getting married, as well as moving into my new role as a developer on johnlewis.com. I joined a team working on the sofa-buying experience, continuing to build React apps, but now with Kotlin microservices in the backend. I worked with a wonderful team of contractors who, again, I learned a lot from and am still in touch with (and I still love Kotlin, even if I don't use it any more). 

My [first-ever conference talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=il9rXYOLWjA) went really well. I got up early and got my hair done for an extra confidence boost. I was so nervous before I went on, but as soon as I got on stage the nerves disappeared and I delivered my talk just like I'd rehearsed. Before the talk, I tweeted out asking for tips from experienced speakers, and it blew up - I ended up writing a [blog post](https://localghost.dev/2018/01/things-experienced-speakers-wish-theyd-known/) about it. I gave a couple more talks at meetups in 2018 - I'd turned my blog post into a talk on [conference speaking tips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqrqDfZt8WE&t=1s) - but I had quite a lot going on in my personal life, so it took a bit of a back seat. 

We got married on a beautiful day in July with our nearest and dearest, and SHE Choir performing, naturally! After the wedding and a glorious honeymoon in south-west Ireland, I started to hunt around for new roles. I had felt for a while that I wasn't happy at John Lewis - the people were wonderful but anyone who's worked in a large organisation will tell you things can move slowly and the organisation can be very resistant to change. A senior colleague once said to me, "never be too comfortable for more than a month", and I realised that was the problem: I was one of a only a few web developers, and there wasn't really anything more ambitious I could do to level up any more. I needed a new challenge. (Also, my Java experience had resulted in me having to make changes to the legacy retail platform which I immediately regretted after being caught up in a 3-week long release cycle.)

Towards the end of July I started interviewing at other companies; I'm grateful to work in an industry - and a city - where there are plenty of jobs. I knew I wanted to work somewhere that hosted community events, as the tech community had been so important for me and my own professional development, so I looked through the Codebar sponsors page for places to apply -  and there was Monzo. I was already a customer, and I figured I was unlikely to get the job because it was a cool tech company for cool people, but I might as well apply. 

First there was a phone call, then a technical task, then a face-to-face interview. During the interview, I gave my interviewer (who is now my teammate!) a good grilling. Job interviews should be two-way - you're interviewing them as much as they are interviewing you, because you have to know if the place is right for you. While preparing for the interview, I collected some excellent advice from some friends in the industry, and coupled it with my experiences from my job at the time to formulate the questions I would ask (I wrote a [blog post](https://localghost.dev/2019/08/what-questions-should-you-ask-at-an-engineering-interview/) about these questions). The next day, I got the call - I'd got the job! There was a lot of prosecco that evening, and a very bad hangover the next day.

I started at Monzo in November 2018, working on customer service tooling. I was exhausted every day for the first few weeks, learning so much, but it felt amazing. I'd never written Go before, but the backend was so consistent and the tooling for engineers was so great that it made picking it up a lot easier. Everyone was so friendly (and as nerdy as me), and I still managed to maintain my work-life balance, which is something that's really important to me. 

SHE Choir appeared on BBC Radio 4 Woman's Hour in September, which was an incredible honour and a very exciting experience! Tangentially through choir, with a couple of choir pals I recorded some backing vocals for the Netflix series Sex Education. 

## 2019

Last year went by so fast, and I found it pretty hard to remember what happened. I messaged my friend for inspiration, who informed me that my greatest achievement of 2019 was baking some [Danish cinnamon twists](https://nordicfoodliving.com/danish-cinnamon-twist-kanelstang/) for her birthday party. 

At Monzo, I moved from the internal tooling team to the Web Platform team, whose goal is to establish strategy for web at Monzo as well as building tools to make developers' jobs easier and safer. Towards the end of the year I developed and co-ordinated a self-guided tutorial on web engineering at Monzo - my teaching experience came in useful again here! The feedback was hugely positive, and I'm working on turning my experience teaching and writing documentation into a talk. 

Despite my goal of speaking at more conferences, I didn't manage to do much last year. I did attend a few great ones, though - ReactJS Girls in London in May, JSConf EU in Berlin (where I [embroidered the logo](https://twitter.com/type__error/status/1135451009252282371)!) and Lead Dev in London in June, and ffconf in Brighton in November (see my [recap](https://localghost.dev/2019/11/ffconf-2019-future-friends-beside-the-seaside/)). I also gave a talk on how we build customer service tooling at Monzo's single-day event for investors, Investival. 

I also started making more of an effort to write blog posts: after another Node Girls workshop where a couple of students had mentioned that they weren't competent developers yet because they "still had to google stuff", I threw together a list of (almost) [everything I googled in a week](/2019/09/everything-i-googled-in-a-week-as-a-professional-software-engineer/) to prove that we're all doing it, all the time. It went viral, and ended up on Hacker News - it nearly used all 100GB of my Netlify bandwidth. 

In June I made the [Makers Academy Women in Software Power List](https://blog.makersacademy.com/drumroll-please-presenting-the-women-in-software-power-list-2019-9b3706f3422f?gi=d95c8c07b9a5), a very unexpected (and flattering!) award. Full disclosure, I added my own name to the nominations because I thought it would be fun, but I didn't think I'd actually get picked!  

Some more highlights I found on Twitter:

* I took some time off work to [make some dresses](https://twitter.com/type__error/status/1166009127325315072).
* I accidentally sent my manager a Bitmoji of me [jumping out of a toilet](https://twitter.com/type__error/status/1150355892174499840).

A high point of last year was starting a choir at Monzo's London office, called Hot Choral (after Hot Coral, Monzo's trademark neon colour - geddit?). What I thought would be a few people trickling in and out every two weeks turned into a weekly rehearsal with a core group of about 15 keen singers, and a performance at Christmas to a packed-out events space at Monzo HQ. I was so proud. 

And... we recorded some more vocals for Sex Education series 2, which is coming out in January! I can't tell you what I sung, but needless to say it's quite rude. 

## Looking back
It was on a whim that I decided to try out the CS50X course in 2014, and if that hadn't been available I don't know if I would have even thought of trying to learn to code again. If I'd known that bootcamps existed back then, maybe I would've done that instead of a Masters. But ultimately, I got where I am with the experiences that I had. I don't regret dropping out of university that first time, because the series of events that followed led to me being here, doing what I love. I'm so grateful for the people I've worked with, and the people in the tech community, who have helped me grow professionally and personally. 

My biggest takeaways: if you're not happy, don't just put up with it. Life is too short to stick around doing something that makes you miserable. And if you fail at something, try again, or try something different - don't let it bring everything down for you (it's easy to say, I know). And I realise this sounds like a trite quote from Baz Luhrmann's "(Everybody's Free To Wear) Sunscreen". 

Furthermore, antidepressants are [so not a big deal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OG6HZMMDEYA) and I credit them for giving me the ability to function like a normal human being for a lot of this decade, so thanks for that NHS. 

## So, what's next?
I'd like to give more talks in 2020, so if you know any meetups that are looking for speakers, please get in touch! I'm going to try and write more conference talk applications, and generally put myself out there a bit more.

I hope to continue my shitposting well into the new decade, as it has so far got me plenty of Twitter love (and this domain name).
