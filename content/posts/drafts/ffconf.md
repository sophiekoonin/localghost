Now in its 11th year, [ffconf](https://ffconf.org) is one of the biggest events of the year for web developers across the UK (and further afield). Yet somehow I've managed to miss it every year since I got into tech, because of some reason or another - last year I was at the week-long blockchain sales pitch that is Web Summit - so I was understandably very excited to finally be going this year. It takes place at the lovely [Duke of York's Picturehouse](https://www.picturehouses.com/cinema/duke-of-york-s-picturehouse) in Brighton - the first conference I've attended that had cupholders in the seats! 

The quality of talks was incredible, and I came away equal parts inspired and terrified, but I will be first in line when the tickets come out next year. 

### Sharon Steed - Engaging Empathy
Opening the conference was author and communications consultant Sharon Steed. 

### Amina Adewusi

### Alice Bartlett

### Laura Kalbag

### Harry Roberts

### Anna Migas

### Charlotte Dann

### Suz Hinton
