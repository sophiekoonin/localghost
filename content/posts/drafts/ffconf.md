summary: "Tech job interviews are often different flavours of the same thing, regardless of where you apply. Interviewers are likely to ask you questions about your experiences, perhaps a hypothetical question about what you might do in a certain situation, or delve into some of the how-it-works stuff under the hood of whatever programming language you'll be using. However, there's one question that you can *guarantee* will come up: 'Do you have any questions for us?'"
