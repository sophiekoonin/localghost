I've come across a lot of websites in my career (and in daily browsing) that are straight-up inaccessible. And fixing these accessibility problems requires _time_, _people, prioritisation..._ it costs money, basically. As I mentioned in my blog post [7 myths designers and developers believe about web accessibility](https://localghost.dev/2020/10/7-myths-designers-and-developers-believe-about-web-accessibility/), retrofitting accessibility is hard. 

The key is to start out with the right tools for the job - or rather, the right _tags_ for the job. In every website, underneath the layers of CSS, the bloated frameworks, the 45945 API calls, there's good old HTML. 

Semantics is the study of meaning, and semantic HTML is exactly that - HTML tags that convey meaning.
