summary: "Drawing on my own experience teaching English as a foreign language, I’ll take you through some of the most useful teaching skills and how you can use them in a technical context - whether you're coaching a new developer on your team, or writing documentation for a bank employing hundreds of developers."

I was privileged to be brought up with computers in the house, and I've been using them since my little grubby hands were able to move a mouse, so it's not really a surprise to anyone that I ended up working in tech. But the path wasn't always crystal-clear for me - before I learnt to code, I didn't really know what I wanted to do. So, after I graduated from my bachelors degree, I ran off to Spain to be an English teacher. This was a short-lived career, as while I was waiting for my course to start, I did [CS50X](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x) and found my calling: I ended up starting a Masters in Computer Science the following autumn. 

Once I started a full-time job in tech I was amazed at how transferable my teaching skills were. In the Before Times when in-person events were still a thing, I mentored kids and adults learning to code, and those skills really came in useful. And further down the line, I’m mentoring other developers and writing documentation for my organisation, and once again I’m putting those teaching skills to good use. 



### Writing code isn't enough

As developers, it’s vital that we have good communication skills: it’s not enough to just put our heads down and write code all day. 

We need to be able to deal with stakeholders, clients, team members. We need to be able to get new joiners up to speed, and communicate how the project is going to tech leads and product managers. We need to be able to write a JIRA ticket that actually makes sense. We need to be able to explain why something has gone wrong, and what we’re going to do to fix it, to someone who has never touched a line of code. 

The skills that I learnt as a teacher set me up to be able to communicate well and command a room. And while the classroom-management side of things may help more when I’m leading a choir, the other skills are indispensable and I’m going to teach you some of those in this two-part series.



### Core skills, not "soft" skills

The two areas of software development I’m going to focus on in this series of articles are mentoring others and writing documentation. Not the hands-on, super technical side of software development, but vital and often overlooked parts of being a well-rounded developer. Often called “soft” skills, which I absolutely hate, because they’re really important and the word “soft” unfortunately has a negative connotation or dismissed as a “feminine” skill. I've seen these skills referred to as "core" skills, and I like that a lot more as it really emphasises how central they are. 

We may have to mentor others as a tech lead, to onboard a new hire, to teach your kid to code or to show your mum how to edit markdown so that she doesn’t keep emailing to ask you to make copy changes on her website (true story, sorry Mum).

We write documentation when we hand over a project, when we build a tool or piece of software for public consumption or want to educate people about something. And *how* we write is just as important as *what* we write.

So, without further ado, here's a two-part series on the teaching skills that will help you mentor other developers and write excellent documentation.
