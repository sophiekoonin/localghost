I love speaking (both generally and publicly), so if you'd like me to speak at your meetup or conference please send me an email at [sophie@localghost.dev](mailto:sophie@localghost.dev)!

Some of the things I like to talk about include:

- Building accessible and inclusive web applications
- Content-Segit statuscurity-Policy and web security
- How to write great documentation and teach technical concepts
