## About this site

As well as being somewhere I occasionally write things, this site is a throwback to the time when web design was a bit more maximalist than it is now, and websites were collections of weird little code snippets you picked up on your internet travels. Though hopefully it's a little more accessible and performant than sites were back then.

(I stopped short of adding a trailing custom cursor.)

You're welcome to steal any code from this site, just promise me you'll have a go at making it your own and not just copy it straight up.

Like many other people in the early 00s, I learnt to build websites by clicking `View Source`, copying bits I liked, then changing them slightly. It's a bit more complicated than it used to be, but I still strongly believe in learning from others and passing it on.
