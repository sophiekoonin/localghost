## About this site
As well as being somewhere I occasionally write things, this site is a throwback to when web design was ridiculously over-the-top, and websites were collections of code snippets you picked up on your internet travels. Though hopefully it's a little more accessible and performant than sites were back then.

You're welcome to copy any HTML/CSS from this site, just promise me you'll have a go at making it your own.

Like many other people in the early 00s, I learnt to build websites by clicking `View Source`, copying bits I liked, then changing them slightly. It's a bit more difficult than it used to be, but I still strongly believe in learning from others and passing it on.
