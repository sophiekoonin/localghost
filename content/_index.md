Iâ€™m a senior web engineer and Web Discipline lead at [Monzo](https://www.monzo.com).

I care about web accessibility, keeping the web fun, and lowering the barrier to entry for people learning web development.

I build web things by day, but by night I make music with [SHE Choir London](https://shechoir.com/london).
