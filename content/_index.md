I'm a web-focussed product engineer at [incident.io](https://incident.io), building software to help companies manage, resolve and learn from incidents. 

Prior to this I was a senior web engineer and Web Discipline lead at [Monzo](https://www.monzo.com).

I care about web accessibility, keeping the web fun, and lowering the barrier to entry for people learning web development.

By day I build web things, but by night I make music with [SHE Choir London](https://shechoir.com/london). Very occasionally I do coding for fun, like the [emojinator](https://emojinator.fun).
