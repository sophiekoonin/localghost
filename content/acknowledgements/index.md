Like many other people in the early 2000s, I learnt to build websites by clicking "View Source", copying bits I liked, then changing them slightly. It's a bit more difficult than it used to be, but I still strongly believe in learning from others and passing it on. Some of the design choices on this website have been inspired by other developers, other websites and things I've seen, so I wanted to give credit where credit is due.
