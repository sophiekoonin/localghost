Sometimes I build silly things for fun - and I do non-tech things too! Here are some of my recent projects:

* [Emojinator](https://emojinator.fun) - create weird and wonderful emoji
* [Virtual Piano](https://virtualpiano.vercel.app) - an interactive virtual piano using the Web Audio API that will also play you scales and chords in a given key
* [Ten Hours Bot](https://www.twitter.com/tenhoursbot) - a Twitter bot that posts random YouTube video titles and adds "10 hours" to the name
* I make music and share it on [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/kid-gloves) ðŸŽ¶
