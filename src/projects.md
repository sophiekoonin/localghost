I like to build weird things for fun - and I do non-tech things too! Here are some of my recent projects:

* [Emojinator](https://emojinator.fun) - create weird and wonderful emoji
* [Virtual Piano](https://virtualpiano.vercel.app) - an interactive virtual piano using the Web Audio API that will also play you scales and chords in a given key
* [Tasting Menu Generator](https://tasting-menu.neocities.org) - generate a 5-course tasting menu
* [Anything Ipsum](https://sophiekoonin.github.io/anything-ipsum/) - the lorem ipsum text generator
* I have a [Codepen](https://codepen.io/sophiekoonin) where I post snippets and little experiments
* I make music and share it on [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/kid-gloves) ðŸŽ¶
