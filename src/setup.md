## Coding

### IDE
![A VSCode window with the source code for this website. I have two embeded terminals open at the bottom; the left-hand one has the Eleventy compiler running, and the right-hand one is just a command prompt with "hello" written in cursive out of ASCII chars. The background colour is navy blue, with pastel-coloured variables and keywords.](/img/tech-setup/vscode.png)

I use VSCode for all my frontend work, with the [Digi-Angler dark theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Digi-Angler.digi-angler-dark-theme) and [Dank Mono](https://philpl.gumroad.com/l/dank-mono) for the font. I used Copilot religiously for personal projects while it was in beta, but I'm not sure how I feel about paying a subscription for something that's trained off users' public repos. Still making my mind up on that one.

If I'm doing backend work, I love a good JetBrains IDE, but I'm leaning more towards web these days.

Here are some of my favourite extensions!
* [Change Color Format](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bbugh.change-color-format) - Quickly transform colors to and from hex (#RRGGBB/AA), hsl(), rgb() and more.
* [change-case](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wmaurer.change-case) - Quickly change the case (camelCase, CONSTANT_CASE, 
* [GitLens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens) - see git annotations at-a-glance from within the editor
* [Todo Tree](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Gruntfuggly.todo-tree) -  Show TODO, FIXME, etc. 
* [vscode-pets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tonybaloney.vscode-pets) - Pets for your VS Code
* [TinyPNG](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=andi1984.tinypng) - Use TinyPNG from within VSCode

### Terminal 
My terminal is zsh, using [Oh My ZSH](https://ohmyz.sh/). I customised the command prompt, inspired by [Sally](https://twitter.com/sallylait/status/1499685147700043776)! I'm using a hacked-up version of the Bullet Train theme for Oh My Zsh, which I've [uploaded to Github](https://github.com/sophiekoonin/config/blob/main/bullet-train.zsh-theme). My terminal of choice is [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/).

## Music

When I'm recording arrangements or covers, I set up a little home studio in my office. I use Logic Pro to record, and my M1 Mac handles it amazingly. 

### Microphone
I use a RODE NT-1. It's compact enough that I can put it away in a drawer quite easily, and prop the stand up against the wall. I got it from [Thomann](https://www.thomann.de/gb/index.html), but before Brexit, so no customs ðŸ¥²

It's an analog mic, so needs an audio interface to be able to send digital signals to a computer. To connect the mic to my laptop I've got a [Focusrite Scarlett Solo](https://focusrite.com/en/audio-interface/scarlett/scarlett-solo), which connects via USB.

### Midi controller
When I'm programming in instruments I'll either do it directly into Logic, or use an [Akai MPC Mini mk2](https://www.akaipro.com/mpk-mini-mkii). It's so cute and small, and fits perfectly in the drawer when I'm not using it.
