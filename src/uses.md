### Software

![A VSCode window with the source code for this website. I have two embeded terminals open at the bottom; the left-hand one has the Eleventy compiler running, and the right-hand one is just a command prompt with "hello" written in cursive out of ASCII chars.

* **DAW:** Logic Pro

* **Audio interface**: [Focusrite Scarlett Solo](https://focusrite.com/en/audio-interface/scarlett/scarlett-solo)
* **MIDI controller**: When I'm programming in instruments I'll either do it directly into Logic, or use an [Akai MPC Mini mk2](https://www.akaipro.com/mpk-mini-mkii). It's so cute and small, and fits perfectly in the drawer when I'm not using it.

## Coffee
I'd say we're coffee snobs compared to a lot of people, but less than a lot of folks I know; we don't have a barista coffee maker at home because it's too much effort, and I don't watch James Hoffmann videos, I just like good coffee.

* **Machine**: we use a [Melitta LOOK Therm Timer](https://www.melitta.co.uk/products/coffee-machines/filter-coffee-machines/look-iv-therm-timer-filter-coffee-machine-black/) machine, a filter machine with a programmable timer so we can set it to brew coffee for us when we wake up. It's nothing fancy, but it's perfect.  
* **Grinder**: [Fellow Opus](https://rountoncoffee.co.uk/products/fellow-opus-grinder). It's smart, tidy and relatively quiet. 
* **Beans**: we get good quality coffee from South London-based [Old Spike](https://oldspikeroastery.com) &ndash; their Roasters Choice subscription means it's a different one every month, and it's always excellent. They also do a lot of work with homeless people to train them and employ them in their cafes or roastery. 
* **Decaf**: [Square Mile decaf filter](https://shop.squaremilecoffee.com/products/decaf-filter)


## Beauty
I can't claim to have my finger on the pulse of beauty any more. I used to be really into makeup and skincare, subscribe to loads of beauty blogs (this was some time ago) and constantly be buying makeup; working full time and not wearing makeup for the best part of two years over lockdown definitely made me less interested in it. I rarely wear a full face these days unless I'm doing a conference talk or dressing up for a special occasion. Most days if I'm in the office I'll just stick to eyeliner and mascara, or anything else that doesn't take long to apply. 

### Skincare
My skincare regime, in order. I've been making my way through a backlog of minis I got from various advent calendars and beauty boxes, so I'm using a variety of different products, but these are some reliable ones.
1. **Toner**: [Medik8 Press & Glow Tonic](https://www.cultbeauty.co.uk/medik8-press-and-glow-tonic-200ml/12708819.html) or [Glow Recipe Watermelon PHA + BHA Toner](https://www.cultbeauty.co.uk/glow-recipe-watermelon-glow-pha-bha-pore-tight-toner-various-sizes/13317625.html?autocomplete=productsuggestion)
2. **Serum**: [The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid](https://www.cultbeauty.co.uk/the-ordinary-hyaluronic-acid-2-b5-30ml/11363395.html)
3. **Moisturizer** or oil: [Grown Alchemist Hydra-Repair Day Cream](https://grownalchemist.com/uk/products/hydra-repair-day-cream-65ml) smells delicious and feels amazing; [The Ordinary Squalane oil]() is a good all-purpose facial oil.
4. **Sunscreen**: [Glossier Invisible Shield](https://www.glossier.com/products/invisible-shield) SPF 30 sunscreen, or [La Roche-Posay Anthelios SPF 50](https://www.cultbeauty.co.uk/la-roche-posay-anthelios-uvmune-400-hydrating-suncream-spf-50-50ml/13494909.html). Always wear sunscreen, regardless of the weather!

* **Retinol**: when I remember (rarely) I use [The Inkey List Retinol Serum](https://www.cultbeauty.co.uk/the-inkey-list-retinol-serum-30ml/12208009.html) in the evenings. 
* **Deodorant**: I'm a fan of Wild &ndash; here's a [referral link](https://mention-me.com/m/ol/dr2mv-sophie-koonin) for 50% off.

### Makeup
* **Eyeliner**: for the past 15 years I've been a big fan of [Urban Decay's 24/7 eyeliner pencils](https://www.sephora.co.uk/p/Urban-Decay-247-Glide-On-Eye-Pencil-1-2g?q=urban+decaty&q_typ=f), though I find some shades do smudge. My favourite shades are Rockstar (metallic aubergine), Stash (dirty green-gold) and Mildew (metallic khaki green).
  * If I need something that's not going to move, [NYX Epic Wear](https://www.nyxcosmetics.co.uk/eyes/eyeliner/epic-wear-liquid-eye-liner/NYX_806.html) is the one, but it does take a careful hand and can be very messy to apply.
  * My daily go-to is [Stila's Stay All Day eyeliner pen](https://www.boots.com/stila-stay-all-day-waterproof-liquid-eye-liner-10129543).
* **Eyeshadow**: I've got a huge collection that I amassed in my twenties, mostly Urban Decay and [Sugarpill](https://tiltmakeup.com/products/sugarpill-pro-pan-pressed-eyeshadow?variant=32927600115792) &ndash; but these days, if I ever wear eyeshadow it's usually a [Glossier Lidstar](https://uk.glossier.com/products/lidstar?variant=41611454578735) because it takes 2 seconds to apply. 
* **Blush**: [Glossier Cloud Paint](https://uk.glossier.com/products/cloud-paint) and nothing else, ever. I usually wear Dusk.
* **Foundation**: [NARS Light Reflecting Advanced Skincare](https://www.narscosmetics.co.uk/en/light-reflecting-advanced-skincare-foundation/999NAC0000141.html) foundation. A long name for something light coverage that evens things out and doesn't dry my skin out.
* **Mascara**: I get terrible panda eyes from most mascaras, so I stick to tubing mascaras that don't budge. My favourites are [Clinique Lash Power](https://www.clinique.co.uk/product/1606/58211/makeup/mascara/lash-powertm-mascara-long-wearing-formula?shade=Black_Onyx) which *does not budge ever*, and [Hourglass Unlocked Instant Extensions](https://www.hourglasscosmetics.co.uk/products/unlocked-instant-extensions-mascara). 
* **Lipstick**: I rarely wear it these days but I am a fan of anything I don't have to constantly reapply. [Lime Crime Velvetines](https://limecrime.com/products/velvetines-liquid-lipstick) are reliably good; MAC is a staple. 

### Fragrance
I have a few favourites that I rotate depending on the season/my mood. 
* [Diptyque Philosykos](https://www.diptyqueparis.com/en_uk/p/philosykos-eau-de-parfum-75ml-1.html) &ndash; I love anything fig-scented, and this is just divine. My all-time favourite. 
* [Le Labo Matcha](https://www.lelabofragrances.com/th-matcha-26.html) &ndash; a lovely, fresh, green fragrance. It's been great in spring/summer.
* I also really like [Le Labo Santal 33](https://www.lelabofragrances.com/santal-33-147.html?size=100ml), unlike my usual greener tastes with its heady florals and peppery notes. I keep smelling it everywhere, it's a very popular one!
* [Miu Miu L'Eau Bleue](https://www.miumiu.com/gb/en/miumiu-club/fragrances/miumiu-eau-bleue.html) &ndash; fresh white flowers and a hint of pepper. I wore this on my wedding day.
