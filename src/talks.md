I love public speaking, so if you’d like me to speak at your meetup or conference please send me an email at [sophie@localghost.dev](mailto:sophie@localghost.dev)!

Some of the things I like to talk about include:

* The independent web and creativity
* Building accessible and inclusive web applications
* Content-Security-Policy and web security
* How to write great documentation and teach technical concepts
* Fun web things I've built
