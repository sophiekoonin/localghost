Michael Hobbes and Peter Shamshiri take us through some of the biggest "self-help"/pseudoscience books from the last few decades and deservedly tear them apart. <!--more--> 

Some of the worst relationship books are here &ndash; _Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus_, _The 5 Love Languages_, _The Rules_ and _The Game_ (yes, that dreadful pickup artist one) &ndash; alongside pop-economics and pop-psychology rubbish such as _Freakonomics_ and _Atomic Habits_. One of the funniest podcasts I've listened to in a while, and honestly gobsmacking that these books were so well-received in the first place. I feel like this should be called "Citation Needed: The Podcast".
