* [You Are Not Meant To Scale - Keith Kurson](https://keith.is/blog/you-are-not-meant-to-scale/) - “Take a deep breath, and say out loud: I am not a machine, I am not meant to scale. You have a finite amount of energy, and a community of people around you who can use that energy. You can use that energy, to make it through the day, which is the most important thing. Waking up tomorrow is the name of the game.”
* [Tech continues to be political - Miriam Suzanne](https://www.miriamsuzanne.com/2025/02/12/tech-ai-wtf/) - “There are certainly a number of people raising alarms or expressing frustration, but we’re often dismissed as uninformed. Based on every conference I’ve attended over the last year, I can absolutely say we’re a fringe minority. And it’s wearing me out. I don’t know how to participate in a community that so eagerly brushes aside the active and intentional/foundational harms of a technology. In return for what? Faster copypasta? Automation tools being rebranded as an “agentic” web? Assurance that we won’t be left behind?”
* [CSS { In Real Life } | Debating the Merits of LLMs](https://css-irl.info/debating-the-merits-of-llms/) - “ An LLM [trained on thousands of documents], while useful, shouldn’t invent new information. It processes the text that already exists, not the science behind it, and if it appears to offer up something new then that should be met with the utmost scrutiny. And it remains to be seen whether they (and others like them) will be worth the extraordinary amount of energy and resources that AI demands.”
