* [Please, don’t force me to log in](https://hamatti.org/posts/please-dont-force-me-to-log-in/) - It feels like every website or connected device wants you to sign up before you can use it these days…
* [Old'aVista](https://www.oldavista.com/) - Altavista was my first search engine (or should I say altavista+was+my+first+search+engine) and this is a delightful trip down memory lane.
* [Inside .git](https://jvns.ca/blog/2024/01/26/inside-git/) - Legendary explainer of things Julia Evans has written a fascinating and understandable guide to what lives inside the .git folder.

* [Where have all the websites gone?](https://www.fromjason.xyz/p/notebook/where-have-all-the-websites-gone/) - A heartfelt lamentation for the human web.
* [Oh Hello Ana](https://ohhelloana.blog/another-round-of-bookmarks/) - Ana Rodrigues has posted a very comprehensive list of good tech and web-related links.
* [It feels like React is getting a bit of a kicking recently - Piccalilli](https://piccalil.li/blog/react-is-getting-a-bit-of-a-kicking-recently/) - There's a lot of React criticism floating around at the mo, much of it justified.

But as someone working on a very big, very complex project that does benefit from a framework like React, I'm glad Andy is taking a nuanced look at the debate. 
* [A highly configurable switch component using modern CSS techniques - Piccalilli](https://piccalil.li/blog/a-highly-configurable-switch-component-using-modern-css/) - We’ve all built plenty of switches out of checkboxes, I’m sure, but Andy has updated his technique to use some newer CSS features and produced a rather lovely result.
