As I approach the end of week 3 of my final sabbatical (sob), I thought I'd update with some medium-sized news in the form of a medium-sized dog:

// TODO 

Her name is Penny, and we're obsessed with her. She's a staffy mix (and a rescue, so the rest is a mystery) and she's the cuddliest dog I have EVER met. We've been working hard on lead training, as she is a terrible goblin on the lead and wants to chase anything small and furry, but then she makes up for it by doing things like this:

## Designing the front garden 

I've spent most of my sabbatical gardening: it was finally time to tackle our massively overgrown front garden. My original plan was to get someone in to design the space (just a planting scheme, nothing hugely fancy) but the cheapest quote I got was Â£1500. So I decided I'd do it myself - how hard could it be? (the answer is very) - and spent some quality time with a (now rather chewed, thanks to Penny) copy of What Plant Where. I made a spreadsheet of all the plants that would work in our heavy clay soil, organised into whether they're shade-lovers (for the north-facing bed) or sun-lovers (for the south-facing bed). I even used a colour scheme generation tool ([coolors

It's important to find a mix of plants that provide year-round interest, so you don't end up with a riot of colour in summer and a sad wasteland the rest of the year. So in my spreadsheet I also included what months the plants are interesting in and made sure to include a good number of evergreens. 

I ended up with something like this:

The next step was to produce a scale drawing of the plot. It's quite a uniquely shaped plot as we live on the corner of a road,
