Say hello to the [Mykeyclub MKC75](https://www.mykeyclub.com/pages/mkc75-preorder-page)! 

![The keyboard on a white desk. It has a pastel purple case, and white keys with pastel coloured accents: a purple CMD key, a blue alt key, and a green ISO enter key. The F-key row are all pastel coloured fruits. On the top right is an iridescent purple knob.](/img/blog/mkc75/mkc75.jpeg)

It's so pretty! This is going to be my new office keyboard. Weighted aluminium case, so nice and heavy without too much rattle. It's got a rotary encoder (that's a knob to you and me) which controls the system volume (I look forward to forgetting it's there).

I put in [Dangkeebs HaluHalo linear switches](https://dangkeebs.com/products/haluhalo-v2) which I got from [SerpentKeys](https://www.serpentkeys.co.uk/). They're a tiny bit louder than reds, but not much. I've recently discovered how dreamy lubricated switches are, although the [process of lubing switches](https://switchandclick.com/the-ultimate-guide-lube-your-mechanical-keyboard-switches/) takes fucking forever &ndash; it took me at least 2 episodes of Fallout and several episodes of Kin &ndash; but typing on them is just delightful.
