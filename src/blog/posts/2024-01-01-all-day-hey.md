Two years after [All Day Hey](https://heypresents.com/conferences/2024) made me [realise I missed the web](https://localghost.dev/blog/when-going-back-doesn-t-mean-going-backwards/), I'm really excited to be speaking there myself! I'll be talking about **technical migrations** &ndash; how we recently pulled off a Typescript migration at Monzo, and things you should consider when doing a migration yourself. 

And what a line up - my good pals [Hidde](https://hidde.blog) and [Ana](https://ohhelloana.blog), plus UX whiz [Imran Afzal](https://www.imranafzal.com/), and two of my lovely Monzo colleagues Heldiney and Giorgio. It's a complete coincidence we ended up speaking at the same conference! I've spoken alongside Heldiney once before, at UX London 2022 &ndash; he was just brilliant. 

All Day Hey is certified good vibes throughout, PLUS it's in a cinema that has sofas instead of cinema seats. SOFAS. It's not long to go now so make sure you've got your ticket!
