*This is an updated version of the talk I gave at several conferences throughout 2022/23, including Beyond Tellerrand, CSS Day and FFConf.*

If you take one thing away from this post: I want you to build your own website. And I don’t mean build the website that everyone has with the sections, calls to action and feature grids.

There's a hero section with a big title that says 'We're unique' and a CTA labelled 'Find out how unique'. Underneath it says 'This is the bit where you talk about how unique you are as a business and that you're different to all of your competitors.
Your website looks the same though.' At the bottom there's a panel with three columns, illustrations of symbols and the text 'always three columns'. The first column: 'You could have four columns here but you won't. You'll have three, like everyone else.'. Second column: 'Have a cog icon above one of these columns if you're really feeling especially creative.'. Third column: 'The perfect place to talk about your services. Because co-incidentally, you have three of them.'">

No, I mean a space that's *entirely yours*: a reflection of your personality in HTML and CSS (and a little bit of JS, as a treat). This could be a professional portfolio, listing your accomplishments... or it could be something very weird and pointless (even better). I love a good one-joke website. 

Ultimately, it's your space and you can do whatever you want with it.

In the early days of the web, there were a lot of sites like this. People would build websites for their families, fansites for bands they liked, or just homepages they filled with random junk. It was a fun thing to do, and a great way to connect with people. But this seems to have been lost somewhere.

It feels like we've lost this decades-old art form; the individuality of design and the uniqueness of content you used to see. The notion of experimenting with HTML and CSS without worrying about something looking weird or out of place. The beauty of a website built by a person, because they wanted to.

### But websites = business!

Many of you reading this will probably get paid to build websites. And a lot of these websites will probably be very similar: marketing, e-commerce, ultimately something designed to make money either by selling something or advertising something. Maybe you've had to stick some tracking pixels in, do some a/b testing to see what variant converts better, and do some forbidden invocations to get Tag Manager working. 

And these sites all look *identical*. The same style of icons, hero images with a CTA, the same pops of the same colours. And a lot of the content is similar too, because it's been  what works for SEO. I gave this talk before Generative AI was quite so ubiquitous, and it's even worse now with so many websites full of absolute garbage content spewed out of ChatGPT. 

These sites are providing a service, and are transactional in nature. There's always going to be a place on the internet for them, and goodness knows I love to shop online. But I'm asking: **where did the fun web go?**

I learned HTML back in 2000 and things were pretty, well, basic back then. I can't imagine how intimidating it must be to be a newcomer now with all of these frameworks and expectations. If you do get into web dev now you're probably doing it to make a career of it; you might do a bootcamp, or a course, some kind of formalised training. And if you are studying with a view to doing it professionally, you're much more likely to target what people are hiring for &ndash; whichever framework is so hot right now &ndash; skipping right over the basics.

I'm not saying don't use frameworks, but you do need that foundational knowledge of HTML and CSS to build good, accessible, performant websites. 

### But I still have fun on the web!

Well, sure. But ultimately the websites we use for fun are also for business. Think about how you use the web today: chances are, many of you spend the majority of your time on a handful of websites and apps owned by big companies. 

Under the guise of a free service, these companies are making money from data they're harvesting from us. ("We are the product" may be a cliché at this point, but it's a cliché for a reason.) They might not be explicitly selling it on, but they are likely using your data to feed into advertising algorithms. We upload images, videos, run our social lives and even our businesses on these platforms. Instagram's terms of service give Meta carte blanche to reproduce, distribute or copy your images royalty-free. 

Meta makes an absolute killing on advertising that can reach highly specific target markets, and they wouldn't be able to do that without using your personal data and browsing habits to label your user account with things they think you like. 

Have you looked at your Instagram/Facebook settings lately, in the ad preferences section? It's quite illuminating what they decide to use to target you.

Laura Kalbag gave [a great talk about digital privacy](https://ffconf.org/talks/privacy/) at FFConf 2019, and it was this talk that spurred me on to ditch Gmail and set up a paid-for email account. I recommend giving it a watch.

#### Internet of Slop

When I originally wrote this talk, generative AI was something people were just starting to experiment with, mainly to make really stupid-looking generated images with DALL-E. Within a couple of years it's absolutely everywhere: we have a million identical "AI" startups popping up &ndash; many of whose products are just ChatGPT in a trenchcoat &ndash; and creators’ work is being ripped off left right and centre. Companies like LinkedIn are starting to use our data and the content we post on their platforms to train their models, but even worse, most are making it *opt-out*. (Side note, imagine a model trained on the entirety of LinkedIn; talk about garbage-in-garbage-out.)

I’d like to point you towards Maggie Appleton’s excellent talk [The Expanding Dark Forest and Generative AI](https://maggieappleton.com/forest-talk) (there’s also a very good talk version that I saw at FFConf 2023) which goes into this in a little more detail and offers some food for thought that may give you indigestion. People have already started putting little badges on their site that say “Made by a human”, and Maggie asks: is there a future in which we need to have 

> [It] feels like we’re surrounded by content that doesn’t feel authentic and human. Lots of this content is authored by bots, marketing automation, and growth hackers pumping out generic clickbait with ulterior motives.

The moral of this is: we’ve come an awfully long way from the days when we were the creators, and we owned our own content.



------ 


social media biggest offender
write post, upload videos, share images on centralised platforms
conduct business
cliche, but we are product - they use our data 
we own data, but they can reproduce, copy, distribute it royalty-free.
make money off us

We’ve come a long way from the days when we were the creators, and we owned our own content.

when it comes to content, moderate yourself
aim to please your audienc
dopamine hits - follows, likes 
“what can I post that people will respond positively to?”.  
same thumbnail on youtube, same variations of tweets
creating content to become viral -> monetise



char limit -> pre-empting backlash when you post something
“how could someone twist this”
no reply guys on your own site
putting things out on the internet for yourself.
you could replace “twitter” with any other social network pretty much

Social media account -> lowest-friction online presence
no tech knowledge, no money, captive audience
- can’t see much of page without account (e.g. restaurants)

good for staying in touch
breaking the ice
cost of lack of creative freedom
data belongs to someone else’s platform

and this content stays on one platform
break rule, banned, lose content
can’t speak to anyone to dispute
interactions not transferrable
when I left twitter I had to export my data - it didn’t come for ages

sites die - e.g. Myspace, 12 years of data, 2019
