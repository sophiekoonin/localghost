First conference of the year is done, and what a conference it was! I begged Josh to let me speak at [All Day Hey](https://heypresents.com/conferences/2024) in 2022, and he promised me a slot in 2024 which at the time seemed forever away. As seems to happen a lot now, I blinked and it was just around the corner.

It was the first outing for my new talk on technical migrations, and I'm really pleased with how it went. If you missed All Day Hey, you'll be able to catch it at [Pixel Pioneers](https://pixelpioneers.co/) in June, and [Smashing Freiburg](https://smashingconf.com/freiburg-2024/) in September. 

I'm not going to write a whole recap of the conference because I am absolutely thoroughly exhausted, but it was obviously brilliant and you should definitely go next year. Top tier lovely vibes. 

Yesterday morning before my train home I had a mooch around the Corn Exchange with [Carol](https://carol.gg). We popped in to the lovely bookshop [Colours May Vary](https://coloursmayvary.com) where I picked up a copy of [Gardener's Folklore](https://coloursmayvary.com/products/gardeners-folklore-the-ancient-secrets-for-gardening-magic-margaret-baker), originally published in 1976. I'm looking forward to leafing through that and perhaps even picking out some useful tips among the absolutely batshit suggestions and stories.

We got lured in to [Giant Kitten](https://www.giant-kitten.com/) by a glass cabinet full of pin badges, and I picked up a few excellent ones to add to my collection along with a great patch and a coaster. My favourite is the Skeletor one, I'm obsessed. I also got this really lovely print by [Clarice Tudor](https://claricetudor.com) which for me completely and utterly sums up the beauty of personal websites.

Highly relatable coaster by [Betiobca](https://www.etsy.com/shop/Betiobca); magic pin by [Wildflower](https://wildflower.co) and is not *that* kind of magic; my soulmate Gudetama pin from [PunkyPins](https://punkypins.co.uk). Skeletor pin and Lisa patch seem to have lots of versions on the internet.
