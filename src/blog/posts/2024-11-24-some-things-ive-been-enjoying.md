What's been going on?

## TV 

I mentioned to my husband that I'd never watched Life on Mars, so we're watching it all the way through, and it's brilliant, obviously. I'm horribly annoying when watching things that have been filmed in places I know because I will a) announce where it is and b) complain if a character goes from one place to another in a way that isn't geographically possible. For example, the most recent series of You involved the main character walking home from his place of work &ndash; the campus of Royal Holloway &ndash; through Spitalfields market, which is a [9 hour walk](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/royal+holloway/Spitalfields+Market,+Brushfield+Street,+London/@51.464751,-0.4868559,11z/data=!3m2!4b1!5s0x48761cb3f857c8a5:0x30e5c1c4eb5d18f5!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x48767755f3ce74c9:0xd04339084bd84568!2m2!1d-0.5667494!2d51.4247097!1m5!1m1!1s0x48761cb4130ec9fd:0x77c1110edca01be0!2m2!1d-0.0760688!2d51.5197441!3e2?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MTExOS4yIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D). Life on Mars is set in Manchester in the 1970s, so there are about 4 streets in the Northern Quarter/Ancoats area that pop up repeatedly, as well as a courthouse I'm fairly sure was the university humanities building where I had a lot of lectures. James is a patient man. 

*He'd* never watched Look Around You (which my university housemates and I were thoroughly obsessed with) so we've been re-watching that as well and I'm happy he's enjoying it. For the uninitiated, it's a parody science programme &ndash; zthe first series parodies 1980s educational programmes and the second series is much like Tomorrow's World, with presenters (including Olivia Colman) and bizarre scientific inventions. Featuring cameos from such icons as Simon Pegg, Edgar Wright, Nick Frost, Mark Heap and Harry Enfield. Series 1 is probably better, but nothing tops the actor Kevin Eldon singing [Machadaynu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwyuB8QKzBI). 

I've also been persuaded to start watching Arcane, and though I've only watched one episode so far I really like the art style! 

## Art

A couple of months ago I went to see *Fragile Beauty*, the [exhibition](https://www.vam.ac.uk/exhibitions/fragile-beauty-photographs-from-the-sir-elton-john-and-david-furnish-collection) of Elton John & David Furnish's photography collection at the V&A. I've always loved photography &ndash; specifically portrait and documentary photography &ndash; so this was a delight. And there was so much of it! I hadn't really known what to expect, but was amazed to see some prints of iconic works by David Avedon, Cindy Sherman and Nan Goldin amongst others. Each room had been expertly curated and I could've spent hours in there. It's on until early Jan 2025 but I think it's been doing a bit of a world tour, so if it pops up near you I highly recommend it.

## Games

[La Mulana](https://store.steampowered.com/app/230700/LaMulana/) is a fiendishly difficult [Metroidvania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metroidvania) puzzle platformer set in ancient ruins, where you play an archaeologist searching for the secret of La Mulana. I've never persevered with a game this much, ever, and managed to make it about 95% of the way through &ndash; beating some really hard bosses! &ndash; until I got to a really difficult horrible jumping puzzle over some spikes that kept killing me, and decided I couldn't be fucked. I really love a puzzle though, so still rate that game even though I had to play it with the [hint guide](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=377234096) open because it really is impossible. Give me Metroidvania, secret passages and things hidden in plain sight, and I am guaranteed to be a fan.

I also really enjoyed [Heaven's Vault](https://www.inklestudios.com/heavensvault/): described as an "archaeological science-fiction adventure game" (all exciting words), you play Aliya, an archaeologist on the hunt for a missing roboticist in a strange futuristic nebula. You slowly build up a vocabulary of the language of the Ancients, and begin to understand more about what came before. I loved it so much I've put it on my [all-time favourites](/games) list. 

Finally got around to playing [Disco Elysium]() several years after everyone else. It's a story-based game &ndash; it's pretty much entirely walking around, exploring and talking to people at length &ndash; but your dialogue choices and actions affect who you are as a character and how the other people around you perceive you. I'm being a good character because I am physically incapable of being an arsehole to people in video games, but I would like to play it again and be the absolutely unhinged lunatic. It's very funny and the world-building is incredible.
