## Lovely things

* [The Yesterweb](https://yesterweb.org) - A monument to everything I love(d) about the internet, and a movement to reclaim that lost creativity and independence. I've tried to encompass some of that spirit in this website. They publish a zine which is a delight to read.
* [The Useless Web](https://theuselessweb.com) - remember when the internet was pointless?
* [rupify.fun](https://www.rupify.fun/) - turn any text into a rupi kaur poem (by [eli](https://twitter.com/elibelly) & [wendy](https://twitter.com/wmginsberg))
