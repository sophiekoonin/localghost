I got bitten by the mechanical keyboard bug! Here's my collection...

## [KBDFans Tofu65](https://kbdfans.com/collections/tofu65)
[![The KBDFans Tofu65 keyboard with black aluminium case. Its keycaps are purple and black, and the alpha key legends have a gradient from turquoise to peach. It is in Mac ISO layout with a split left shift.](/img/keyboards/tofu65-2.webp)](/img/keyboards/tofu65-2.webp)

Absolutely obsessed with this keyboard. It's heavy, which means a lot of the sound is absorbed. Keyboards for me are about the look and feel, not the sound - so it's red switches all the way! I would be quite happy using this in an office.

Right now it's wearing [Mintlodica DSA Magic Girl](https://mintlodica.com/products/dsa-magic-girl-keycaps) keycaps, but I'm waiting for the [KAT Space Dust](https://prototypist.net/products/group-buy-kat-space-dust?variant=39351637508162) group buy to ship!

## ikki68 Aurora x Dreamscape 
[![The ikki68 Aurora keyboard with white and pastel purple polycarbonate case. Most of the keys are off-white, the escape and pg up/pg down/home/end keys are pastel coloured with fruit legends. It is in Mac ISO layout with a split left shift.](/img/keyboards/ikki68-2.webp)](/img/keyboards/ikki68-2.webp)
I got this as part of the [Dreamscape](https://prototypist.net/collections/pre-orders/products/pre-order-epbt-dreamscape) group buy as I wanted a light-coloured keyboard - how could I resist those colours?? It's a polycarbonate base, so a bit louder than my Tofu even with silicone dampeners. I put o-rings on the keys which helped a bit. It's wearing DSA Milkshake - the first keyset I fell in love with, and was very excited to get my hands on when it was rerun in 2021. 


## [keeb.io BDN9 rev. 2](https://keeb.io/collections/bdn9-collection/products/bdn9-rev-2-3x3-9-key-macropad-rotary-encoder-and-rgb)
[![An angled view of the BDN9 macropad. It is a black square with two rotary knobs at the top, and 7 keys that are pastel coloured with fruit legends. There is a green cable plugged into it.](/img/keyboards/bdn9.jpg)](/img/keyboards/bdn9.jpg)
I use the rotary encoder as a volume control knob, but I haven't quite got round to finding a good use for the rest of the keys! I thought it would be useful for shortcuts in Logic, but old habits die hard and I still use the mouse a lot. It was a good starting project to get to grips with soldering, though. It's wearing some novelties from DSA Milkshake.
