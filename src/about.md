I'm a web developer based in London. My passions are web accessibility, keeping the web fun, and lowering the barrier to entry for people learning web development.

I started building websites on Geocities at the age of 10, graduating over the years to various questionable free hosting sites, `.tk` domains, [Greymatter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greymatter_(software))-powered personal sites hosted on other people's pretentiously-named `.org` domains, and eventually over-engineered Wordpress blogs. It was inevitable that I'd end up doing it for a living.


I'm currently on a sabbatical, but until recently I was a product engineer at [incident.io](https://incident.io), building software to help companies manage, resolve and learn from incidents. Prior to this I was a senior web engineer and Web Discipline lead at [Monzo](https://www.monzo.com). 
  
By day I build web things for fun and profit, but by night I make music with [SHE Choir London](https://shechoir.com/london). I also enjoy gardening, baking, crafting, mechanical keyboards, surreal memes and video games.

## About this site

As well as being somewhere I occasionally write things, this site is a throwback to the time when web design was a bit more maximalist than it is now, and websites were collections of weird little code snippets you picked up on your internet travels. Though hopefully it's a little more accessible and performant than sites were back then.

It's built using the static site generator [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev).

You're welcome to steal any code from this site, just promise me you'll have a go at making it your own and not just copy it straight up.

Like many other people in the early 00s, I learnt to build websites by clicking `View Source`, copying bits I liked, then changing them slightly (that, and absorbing the contents of [lissaexplains.com](https://lissaexplains.com)). It's a bit more complicated than it used to be, but I still strongly believe in learning from others and passing it on.

If you encounter any accessibility/usability issues while on the site, or any images used without permission/proper credit, please do let me know and I'll fix it ASAP.
