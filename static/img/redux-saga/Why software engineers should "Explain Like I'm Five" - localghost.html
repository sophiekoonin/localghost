        <p>There&rsquo;s more to being a software engineer than coding. Being able to actually write code helps, of course, but what people often underestimate are the so-called &ldquo;soft skills&rdquo; (I hate that term) - the way that you interact with others around you. Do you ever stop to think about what you&rsquo;re saying and whether the person you&rsquo;re talking to can actually understand it?</p>

<p>One of the best pieces of advice I ever got was from a tech lead who took all of the engineers aside after a standup where we&rsquo;d been discussing how we were getting on with the new authentication flow we were writing. She told me to make sure I didn&rsquo;t go into too much technical detail in my standup, so that everyone could understand it.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;d just spent ten minutes with the rest of the team - including our product manager and the marketing lead - and we&rsquo;d been talking about refresh tokens and token expiry. It had meant absolutely nothing to several of the people there. The more we mentioned these arcane technical concepts, the less the rest of the team wanted to come along to standups because they felt it was irrelevant or above them in some way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s a standup!&rdquo; I hear you cry. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re only meant to give a quick high-level update anyway!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Well, you&rsquo;d be surprised how easy it is to start talking in jargon without even realising for even the smallest of updates. Next time you give a standup update, ask yourself: how can I explain this like everyone else here is 5?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Explain Like I&rsquo;m Five&rdquo; - or ELI5 - is a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive">subreddit</a> where people can ask questions about (usually) complicated subjects and people answer them as if the asker was five years old. This is a great thing to hold in your mind as a software engineer. I&rsquo;m not suggesting you start explaining microservices to small children, but it&rsquo;s a technique that will get you everywhere when you&rsquo;re working in teams of people with different experience and backgrounds.</p>

<p>How much detail do you really need to go into? If your standup tends to be &ldquo;here&rsquo;s what I did yesterday and here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m doing today&rdquo;, do you need to say:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We&rsquo;re still trying to get the auth service to store the user&rsquo;s refresh token in the database and check it against the incoming requests.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>or can you just say</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We&rsquo;re still trying to get authentication working in the backend.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To you the first example might look pretty easy to understand, but that&rsquo;s probably because you&rsquo;re an engineer. You know what a refresh token is. You know what a request is in this context. Your copywriter probably knows what a database is, and what authentication is, but that&rsquo;s about it, and they&rsquo;ve switched off by the end of the sentence. By keeping the technical detail to a minimum you&rsquo;ll be providing an update that the rest of the team understand, so they know what everyone&rsquo;s working on.</p>

<p>(And to the pedants out there thinking that most 5-year-olds wouldn&rsquo;t understand the concepts of <em>authentication</em> and <em>backend</em> - at least in the engineering sense - so it&rsquo;s not really ELI5, I feel like you know what I&rsquo;m trying to get at here and are being deliberately difficult).</p>

<p>What about if there&rsquo;s a particular technical thing that&rsquo;s blocking you that you wanted to mention in standup? Either mention that you&rsquo;re generally blocked in the update and approach one of your fellow engineers afterwards, or maybe have a 5-minute dev-only standup after the main team standup where you can go into more technical detail.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s another example:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Some of our ElasticSearch nodes went down last night, it turns out we are still on the old cluster so we&rsquo;re going to migrate to the new cluster today.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>vs.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The thing that powers our search tool went down last night, it turns out it was on an old server* so we&rsquo;re going to move it to the newer one today.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>* I know this isn&rsquo;t technically the same thing, but to a product manager and a copywriter, it literally doesn&rsquo;t matter. You can go into more detail in the relevant dev standup/slack channel/coffee break.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not just standups where this skill comes in handy. If you&rsquo;re mentoring another engineer or helping someone work through a problem, being able to explain technical concepts in an easy-to-understand way can really help others to learn from you. You&rsquo;ll find it a useful skill for giving talks - there&rsquo;s a real difference between &ldquo;showing them how&rdquo; and &ldquo;making them understand&rdquo;.</p>

<p>And in your day-to-day role, explaining technical things like your product manager is 5 (or at least 15) might be the thing that convinces them why you should take a break from delivering new features to go back and tackle the mountain of tech debt that&rsquo;s been piling up:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We need to upgrade a lot of the packages, check for security vulnerabilities and replace a lot of deprecated code.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What does &ldquo;deprecated&rdquo; mean? What are packages in this context?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got some old code that needs updating because soon it won&rsquo;t work any more, and it might pose a security risk.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you&rsquo;re worried about coming across patronising, you can always check with your team to establish what kind of technical level they&rsquo;d prefer.</p>
